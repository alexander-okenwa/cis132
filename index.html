<h1>This is a short paragraph about me (5 sentences minimum)</h1>
    <p>My name is Alexander Okenwa. I am a U.S citizen who was originally born and bred in Nigeria. Then, in 2001, I came to the United States of America, and I have lived in the U.S for about twenty-one years, today. I am sixty-two years, today, however, I have had all my primary, secondary, and tertiary education in Nigeria. The first time that I have ever enrolled in a formal academic school in this country was in February of this year, which happens to be the time when I first enrolled in this El camino College, and I have been in it till date. I love every academic experience that I have had and am still having in this college.</p>
